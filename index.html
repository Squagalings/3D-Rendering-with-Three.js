    <h1 style="color:seashell">Welcome to Justine's Corner!</h1>
    <h2 style="color:lavender">Howdy Hey! ðŸ™‚</h2>
    <p style="color:white">Hai, I'm Justine! I am a beginner programmer, and I like to draw. I am NOT an animator. (I'll occasionally make animatics but those aren't on the same level as animations.)</p>

    <h2 style="color:lavender">Favourites</h2>
    <p style="color:white">I like to draw! I'm really bad at it but hey, I'm trying! Hehehehehe anyway, in my drawings I don't use colour. At least, not much. It ruins my drawings and I'm so bad at colouring. (Unless I use pixel fill in Krita, but that's cheating.) I also like to hang out with my friends. (Literally. It's ambiguous.) My favourite colour is pink! It's a lightish pink, though occasionally  a salmon-ey pink will pass. I don't wear dresses/skirts that much, honestly I think they're a waste of fabric but everyone has different opinions. [Also weird thing 'cuz by default all the girls I draw have dresses/skirts and I do draw myself with a dress/skirt. Hidden Powers is an exception(but then, that's FakeMe.)]</p>
